## Installation

At the moment a patched version of package ShinyImage is required, which 
can be obtained from me on request.

The package requires Bioconductor package EBImage, which should be installed
first via

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Install package BiocManager
if(!require(BiocManager)) install.packages("BiocManager")
## Use BiocManager to install EBImage
BiocManager::install("EBImage", update = FALSE)
```

Next, one can install package MultiFlow, where all remaining dependencies will
be installed automatically.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Install package remotes
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
## Install package MultiFlow
remotes::install_github("stamats/MultiFlow", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Start App

```{r}
MultiFlow::runMultiFlowApp()
```


## Open User's Guide

```{r}
vignette("MultiFlow")
```
